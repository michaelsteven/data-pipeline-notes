# Catalyst on CRC

## Installation
Step 1 - setup and run the CRC by following these instructions: 
https://github.com/michaelsteven/data-pipeline-notes/tree/master/code-ready-containers

Step 2 - clone down my fork.
```
https://github.ibm.com/Michael-Hepfer/iteration-zero-ibmcloud
```

Step 3 - Switch to the "mike-working" branch

Step 4 - Rename these files to .BAK so they donâ€™t execute
- stage3-appid.tf
- stage3-cloud_object_storage.tf
- stage3-cloudant.tf
- stage3-logdna.tf
- stage3-sysdig.bak

Step 5 - Open a terminal window and navigate into the iteration-zero-ibmcloud directory

Step 6 - Run the launch.sh script that will create start a docker container and exec in as a bash session in the terminal window
    ```
    ./launch.sh
    ```

Step 7 - From inside the terminal/container, log into the openshift cluster via the cli.
    ```
    oc login --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true -u kubeadmin -p <<your-password>> https://api.crc.testing:6443
    ```
    NOTE: replace "<<your-password>>" with the password displayed when the "crc start" command command completed.

Step 8 - Run the runTerraform.sh scripts as normal
    ```
    ./runTerraform.sh
    ```
Step 9 - when prompted for variable input, put in dummy data

## Cleaning Up
Step 1. In the terminal where the CRC was started, delete the CRC VM instance and start it up again
    ```
    crc delete
    ```
Step 2. In the tools container terminal, delete the terraform workspace folder
    ```
    rm -rf workspace/
    ```
